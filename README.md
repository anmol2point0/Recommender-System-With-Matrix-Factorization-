# Recommender-System-With-Matrix-Factorization-
Matrix Factorization is a method used in recommender systems to predict user preferences for items by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices. These matrices represent latent factors such as user preferences and item characteristics. By learning these latent factors through optimization techniques like gradient descent, Matrix Factorization can accurately predict missing values in the original matrix, effectively recommending items to users based on their preferences and past interactions. Python provides libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow to implement Matrix Factorization models efficiently.
